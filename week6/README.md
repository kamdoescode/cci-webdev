## Webpage that changes with time
To run, download the folder and open `index.html` on your browser. Wait a few minutes and watch as time passed displays in a creative way

### Design Notes
This webpage's style is inspired by the scene in the movie interstellar in which the characters are communicating through the 4th dimension using a bookshelf. I liked the idea of using the gradual build up of lines like a bookcase to display the passing of minutes
