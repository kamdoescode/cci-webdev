# CCI Web Development Module 25/26

this is a repository for the work done in my class **"Coding Three: Web Development Studio"** taken at the UAL Creative Computing Institute.

Projects are organized by week, and each week includes a readme file describing the area of focus for each lesson.

Not included is the final project for the module, my Personal Website, which you can find seperately in the repo **Personal Site**.
